# Tableau CitiBike Challenge





## Purpose

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Conclusion 
Looking at these analytical findings, the city can be advised to allocate funding towards Grove St. Path Station due to higher traffic. 

Furthermore, it will benefit bikers to have safe and accessible routes travelling between Hoboken terminal (Hudson St and Hudson Pl) to Hoboken Terminal (River St and Hudson Pl.). 

Lastly, city of NY to note that the peak biking hours for community bikers - largely classic bike users, are around 6pm, thus allocating funding to maximize security and accomodations will benefit a large population of bikers.
